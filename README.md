Imagine you have a service which helps people to move from one place to another. You have boxes for packaging different types of furniture: ArmchairBox for an armchair, FridgeBox for a fridge, but it's not convenient because boxes differ only in volume. Create a universal class Box, which contains furniture of some type and the volume of a box. Declare a primary constructor for initializing furniture and volume, which is Int. Complete the methods getBoxVolume() and getFurnitureFromBox() for getting both fields of Box.
